  text: `God speaks to each of us as he makes us,
then walks with us silently out of the night.

These are the words we dimly hear:

You, sent out beyond your recall,
go to the limits of your longing.
Embody me.

Flare up like a flame
and make big shadows I can move in.

Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.
Just keep going. No feeling is final.`,
  analysis: {
    overview: `This poem imagines the moment before birth when God whispers instructions to each soul. The divine command is not for safety or happiness but for full embodiment of experience. Rilke's God asks us to become flames casting shadows, to welcome both beauty and terror, to keep going because "no feeling is final." It's become one of the most quoted passages in contemporary spirituality.`,

      {
        lines: '1-2',
        commentary: `God speaks "as he makes us"—creation and instruction are simultaneous. Then God "walks with us silently," present but not speaking again. We must live from that initial whisper.`
      },
      {
        lines: '3',
        commentary: `"Dimly hear"—the words aren't fully clear. We sense our purpose more than know it, feel our direction more than see it.`

      {
        lines: '4-5',
        commentary: `"Sent out beyond your recall"—we cannot return to pre-existence. "Go to the limits of your longing"—pursue desire fully, not halfway.`
      },
      {
        lines: '6',
        commentary: `"Embody me"—two words that contain Rilke's entire theology. God needs us to make the divine manifest in flesh and action.`
      },
      {
        lines: '7-8',
        commentary: `"Flare up like a flame"—be intense, visible, transformative. The shadows we cast give God space to move. Our brightness creates divine possibility.`
      },
      {
        lines: '9-10',
        commentary: `"Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror"—no selective living. The final line, "No feeling is final," offers comfort: whatever we feel will change. Keep going.`
