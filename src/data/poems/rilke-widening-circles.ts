  text: `I live my life in widening circles
that reach out across the world.
I may not complete this last one
but I give myself to it.

I circle around God, around the primordial tower.
I have been circling for thousands of years,
and I still do not know: am I a falcon,
a storm, or a great song?`,
  analysis: {
    overview: `This poem opens "The Book of a Monastic Life," the first section of Rilke's "Book of Hours." Written in the voice of a Russian Orthodox monk, it presents spiritual seeking as an ever-expanding movement rather than a destination. The speaker circles God without reaching, questions without answering—embodying Rilke's belief that living the questions matters more than finding answers.`,

      {
        lines: '1-2',
        commentary: `"Widening circles that reach out across the world" — Life expands outward like ripples. Each circle encompasses more, suggesting spiritual growth as accumulation rather than arrival.`
      },
      {
        lines: '3-4',
        commentary: `"I may not complete this last one" — The speaker accepts incompleteness. The giving of self matters more than finishing. This is devotion without expectation of success.`
      },
      {
        lines: '5',
        commentary: `God is "the primordial tower" — ancient, central, vertical. The speaker orbits this fixed point, moving around what cannot be directly approached.`
      },
      {
        lines: '6',
        commentary: `"Thousands of years" dissolves individual identity into something larger. The speaker becomes all seekers who have ever circled the divine.`
      },
      {
        lines: '7-8',
        commentary: `The three possibilities—falcon, storm, song—move from physical creature to natural force to pure art. The speaker's uncertainty about their own nature is the poem's profound conclusion: we seek without knowing what we are.`

    historicalContext: `Rilke wrote the Book of Hours after two transformative trips to Russia (1899-1900), where he encountered Orthodox Christianity and met Tolstoy. The poems emerged in intense bursts of inspiration, often multiple poems per day, written in the voice of a monk speaking to God.`
