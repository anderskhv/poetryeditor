  text: `And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.
And he said:
Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.`,
  analysis: {
    overview: `"On Children" is perhaps the most frequently quoted passage from "The Prophet," often read at christenings, graduations, and parenting workshops. Gibran presents a radical view of parenthood: children are not possessions but autonomous souls passing through their parents' lives. The poem challenges conventional notions of parental ownership and control.`,
    lineByLine: [
      {
        lines: '1-2',
        commentary: `A mother holding her baby asks about children—the physical intimacy of the image contrasts with Almustafa's message about emotional distance and letting go.`
      },
      {
        lines: '3-4',
        commentary: `"Your children are not your children" — The paradox is immediate and startling. They are "sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself," suggesting children serve a cosmic purpose beyond family.`
      },
      {
        lines: '5-6',
        commentary: `"Through you but not from you" distinguishes parents as channels rather than sources. Children pass through parents like arrows through a bow—the metaphor Gibran develops later.`
      },
      {
        lines: '7-8',
        commentary: `"Give them your love but not your thoughts" — Parents can offer emotion freely but should not impose their worldview. Children must develop their own understanding.`
      },
      {
        lines: '9-11',
        commentary: `"House their bodies but not their souls" — The physical is all parents can truly provide. The soul belongs to "the house of tomorrow," a future the parent cannot access or control.`

    historicalContext: `This poem resonated powerfully with the 1960s-70s movements toward child-centered parenting and continues to influence modern parenting philosophy. Gibran drew on his experience as a child sent away from Lebanon and his observations of immigrant families navigating cultural change.`
