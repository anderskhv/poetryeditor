  text: `Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.`,
  analysis: {
    overview: `"On Joy and Sorrow" presents Gibran's philosophy of emotional interdependence. Rather than treating joy and sorrow as opposites, Almustafa reveals them as two faces of the same experience. The depth of one determines the capacity for the other—a profound reframing of how we understand suffering.`,
    lineByLine: [
      {
        lines: '1-2',
        commentary: `A woman asks about joy and sorrow together, not separately—she intuits they're connected. Almustafa's answer confirms this intuition.`
      },
      {
        lines: '3',
        commentary: `"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked" — Joy doesn't replace sorrow but reveals what sorrow was hiding. They share the same face.`
      },
      {
        lines: '4',
        commentary: `The well metaphor: laughter and tears rise from the same source within us. Our emotional capacity is singular, not divided.`
      },
      {
        lines: '5',
        commentary: `"And how else can it be?" — The rhetorical question suggests this truth is self-evident once seen. There is no other way emotions could work.`
      },
      {
        lines: '6',
        commentary: `"The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain" — Sorrow is a carving tool, creating space. Without depth of sorrow, joy has nowhere to fill.`
